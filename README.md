# Makemore - Bigram-Based Name Generator

Makemore is a lightweight model that generates names using bigram probabilities. It analyzes the structure of input names and predicts new, contextually plausible 
names based on learned patterns.

## Parts 

1. **Count-Based Model**: A straightforward implementation that uses bigram probabilities to generate names by analyzing character pair frequencies.
2. **Neural Network Model**: A basic neural network that learns patterns in the data to generate more nuanced and creative names.

Makemore demonstrates the evolution from traditional probabilistic methods to neural network-based approaches for language modeling.
